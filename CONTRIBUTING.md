# Contributing

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in contributing to the Logistic Units extension! The goal of this document is to provide a high-level overview of how you can get involved.

## Reporting issues

Before you create a new issue, please do a search in [open issues](https://github.com/Extensions-lab/logistic-units/issues) to see if the issue has already been filed.

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug, create a new issue using the guidelines below.

## Writing good bug reports

File a single issue per problem. Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue.

Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless it's for the identical input. Many issues look similar, but have different causes.

The more information you can provide, the more likely someone will be successful at reproducing the issue and finding a fix.

Please include the following with each issue:

**1. Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**2. To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

1. Go to '...'

``` AL code snippet that demonstrates the issue or a link to a code repository the developers can easily pull down to recreate the issue locally ```

**Note:** Because the developers need to copy and paste the code snippet, including a code snippet as a media file (i.e. .gif) is not sufficient.

**3. Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**4. Actual behavior**
A clear and concise description of what happened accompanied by images, animations, or a link to a video showing the issue occurring.

**5. Versions:**

- AL Language. Go to Visual Studio Code → Extensions panel → AL Language 
- Visual Studio Code: Go to Visual Studio Code → Help → About
- Business Central. In the web client, go to Help → Help and Support → Troubleshooting
- List of Visual Studio Code extensions that you have installed. Go to Visual Studio Code → Extensions panel
